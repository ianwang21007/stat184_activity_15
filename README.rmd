# Activity 15-- GitHub Practice

This is the README file for my submission of Activity 15 for my STAT184 class. The current plan is to create two issues, add my Activity 14 QMD, Activity 14 PDF, plan document, and this README file, and then create a pull request to merge my dev branch with the main branch.
