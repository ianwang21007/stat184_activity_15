YAML Header & Document Structure
-	Goal: Create an appropriate YAML header
-	Needs: Quarto, RStudio
-	Steps:
  o	Add a title (Activity 14)
  o	Set the author to be me with my name
  o	Add the date
    	Set date-modified: now to reflect the updating process
  o	Set output information
    	Make sure the margins are 1 inch (number-depth: 5)
    	Set toc to false so there is no table of contents
  o	Make sure the QMD file will render as a pdf
  o	Set cap-location: top so that captions will appear above their figures/tables

Armed Forces Data Wrangling Redux (Activity #08 & #10)
-	Goal: Create a frequency table with a smaller subset of soldiers 
-	Needs: Activity 08 and 10 code, googlesheets4, dplyr, tidyverse, QMD file
-	Steps:
  o	(All inside of a code section in the QMD file)
  o	Load needed packages
  o	Create smaller subset
    	Filter out army and pay grade O ranks
  o	Use tabyl to create a frequency table
    	Use adorn_totals to add a total row
    	Use adorn_percentages to add relative frequencies
    	Use adorn_pct_formatting to set relative frequencies to two decimal places
    	Use adorn_title to add a title
    	Mutate and use across to add commas into the table where numbers need them
  o	Use kable to visualize the frequency table
    	Add a caption “Ranks of US Army Officers by Sex”
    	Style the table with a font size of 16 and adding stripes and condensing the table
  o	Add a paragraph detailing what the frequency table is and what it shows with regards to sex and rank’s relationship in the Army for officers.

Popularity of Baby Names (Activity #13)
-	Goal: Add visualization from Activity 13 into QMD file
-	Needs: Activity 13 code
-	Steps:
  o	Open Activity 13 code in R
  o	Copy and paste the code into the QMD file in a code section
  o	Add a paragraph detailing why I picked the names and what the trends in the graph show with regards to the 4 chosen names

Plotting a Mathematical Function (Activity #03)
-	Goal: Create a function that calculates maximum box volume based on length of side cutout
-	Needs: ggplot2
-	Steps:
  o	Create a function
    	Set length = 36 and width = 48, set x (side cutout length) to be variable
    	Lengthbox = length – 2x
    	Widthbox = width – 2x
    	Heightbox = x
    	Volumebox = lengthbox * widthbox * heightbox
  o	Create a dataframe out of the possible cutout side lengths
    	Trial and error with the graph shows the range should be from 0 to 18 by intervals of 1
  o	Create a plot made with ggplot2
    	Use stat_function to create a line plot using the function
    	Add alt text
    	Add labels and a title
    	Add a theme
    	Make the x scale break in intervals of 1 from 0 to 18
  o	Add a paragraph that describes the line plot and tells what the maximum box volume is and what side length is needed to achieve it.

What You’ve Learned So Far
-	Goal: Write a self-reflection that is meaningful and genuine.
-	Needs: QMD file
-	Steps:
  o	Write a reflection about what this class has taught me

Code Appendix & Code
-	Goal: Create a working code appendix
-	Needs: Quarto crash course
-	Steps:
  o	Make sure the bottom of the QMD file has a code section that appends the code appendix as shown in the quarto crash course

Code Style
-	Goal: Adopt and use a consistent coding style throughout the QMD
-	Needs: Tidyverse code style
-	Steps:
  o	Check to make sure all code adheres to the style

Repo Plan
----

Goal: Use branches to good effect
o	Needs: GitHub
o	Steps:
  	Create a dev branch
  	Commit to dev branches
  	Once all commits are done, create a pull request to merge with the main branch
  	Complete the pull request

Goal: Create and solve two issues
o	Needs: GitHub
o	Steps:
  	Create two issues
    •	Issues: Add QMD/PDF, Add plan
    •	Issues have relevant labels/tags applied
  	Tag issues as they are resolved
    •	Close issues

Goal: Create multiple meaningful commits
o	Needs: GitHub
o	Steps:
  	Each commit should actually serve a purpose
  	Each commit has an appropriate summary message
    •	Message describes What and Why without diving into How
  	Pull requests have both title and description of what the request is meant to accomplish

Goal: Create an appropriate README
o	Needs: GitHub, RStudio
o	Steps:
  	Create a README file in RStudio
  	In the readme, put:
    •	What the repo is about
    •	Where the data is from
    •	Current plan for the project
    •	How the repo is organized
    •	Contact information

Goal: Create a plan document
o	Needs: Microsoft Word, RStudio, GitHub
o	Steps:
  	Plan should include both project and repo
  	Should be complete, with goals, needs, and steps
  	Copy plan from word into R file
  	Commit R file to repo

Goal: Have an output file for the repo

o	Steps:
  	Generate a PDF from Activity #14
  	Commit PDF to repo

Goal: Have a QMD file in the repo
o	Needs: Activity 14 QMD, GitHub
o	Steps:
  	Commit Activity 14 QMD file to the repo
